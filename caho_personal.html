my name is cassandra howard (caho3552@colorado.edu)
& this is my personal file!

nov 21 addition! vv

I am a freshman here at CU Boulder and I'm studying computer science!
Prior coming to Boulder and deciding to major in computer science I've never coded before,
so I plan to slowly love my major as I progress!

I'm originally from North Carolina and moved here to Colorado in August.

Some of my favortie hobbies are playing volleyball and crocheting!
